Economists say changing demographics like ageing and retiring workers are a factor behind the shortages, as well as border controls and immigration limits, and demands for better pay and flexible working arrangements. The latest labor data from the U.S., for example, shows that more workers are willing to walk away from their jobs or to switch employment.
